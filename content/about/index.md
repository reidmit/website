title: About me

Hi, I'm Reid! I’m a software engineer, filmmaker, and UX designer currently living in San Francisco. I’m passionate about education, accessibility, and building experiences that make people's lives a little easier or a little more enjoyable. My pronouns are he/him/his.

These days, I’m especially interested in front-end web development (JavaScript, React, etc), building accessible user interfaces, and programming language design (compiler-writing, type-checking, etc).

Prior to entering the real world, I grew up in a suburb of New York and went to school at Pomona College, where I majored in computer science and film.

I work at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), where I'm helping to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. Previously, I worked on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) at Pivotal Software/VMware. Before that, I worked on data migration tools at Microsoft.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/reidmit).
