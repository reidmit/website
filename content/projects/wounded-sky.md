I made this music video for Ruby Reilly's original song "Wounded Sky." Check out more of Ruby's music [here](https://rubyreilly.bandcamp.com/).

Ruby is from my hometown. I was home from college for Christmas break, I had recently acquired a Super 8mm film camera from a garage sale, and I loved Ruby's music. I felt this song especially could fit with the analog film aesthetic, so we set out to make this video happen.

I had never shot a film camera before. At first, I wasn't even sure if the camera worked; I had to take it to a camera repair shop where they scrubbed old battery acid out of it. But we got it working!

I bought two 50' reels of film, which gave us about 7 minutes of footage total. Since the song is almost 5 minutes long, we were lucky that most of the footage turned out usable.

After getting the film developed, I didn't have the equipment (or experience) to splice the film by hand. I wanted to digitize it so I could edit on my computer with Final Cut Pro. Plus, we would need to add the digital audio at some point anyway.

To do the digitizing, I borrowed a projector and projected the film against my bedroom wall so I could record it with a digital camera. Here's a picture:

This was a ton of fun. I accidentally burned up some of the film by leaving it too close to the bulb for too long, but I got all of it onto my computer.

At the very end of the video, you can see some actual footage of the film burning up as I recorded. And I incorporated the real sounds of me turning the projector on and off. I was really happy with the effects that these created.
