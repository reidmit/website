<p>With A2B, I designed the user experience and user interface for a travel app that would eliminate the frustrating or painful parts of travel planning. As the sole designer on the project, I did the research, prototyping, testing, and final wireframes over the course of three weeks.</p>
<h2 id=the-idea>The idea</h2>
<p>I started with a hypothesis. People love to dream of taking vacations. We have fun coming up with what these trips might look like: where we&rsquo;ll go, what we&rsquo;ll eat, what we&rsquo;ll do. But when we get the chance to actually take the trip, the planning and logistics can quickly suck the fun out of it.</p>
<p>A2B tries to solve this problem. How might an app let someone focus 100% on the fun parts of planning, while taking care of the annoying parts instantly?</p>
<h2 id=the-research>The research</h2>
<p>To validate the hypothesis, I crafted a proto-persona that represented what I imagined the app&rsquo;s target user to be. She was aged 23, tech-savvy, and recently started working full-time. She had always dreamed of traveling the world, but never had the resources until now. She&rsquo;d like to use some of her newfound income and her vacation days to finally explore the world.</p>
<p>I interviewed 5 people who roughly fit the demographic of my proto-persona, all based in San Francisco, and I sent a survey out via social media to collect a lot of data about people&rsquo;s travel planning habits. The questions generally focused on <strong>identifying which parts of travel planning are fun, and which parts were painful</strong>.</p>
<p>The results were surprisingly consistent: When planning a trip, people loved to research things to do in their destinations (searching the internet, making must-see lists, asking others for recommendations, starting group chats with friends, etc). But the least-fun parts were all logistical: booking travel, figuring out how to get between places in their destination, and ensuring that they were scheduling their days efficiently. There was a general feeling that <strong>it is hard to make the most of a person&rsquo;s limited time in a new city</strong>.</p>
<h2 id=the-persona>The persona</h2>
<p>Based on these findings, I developed a final persona, named Angela, who was quite similar to my proto-persona. She was most interested in visiting European cities, especially Paris. The most notable difference from my proto-persona was her focus on traveling with friends. She often traveled in groups, and she had felt a lot of pain around making sure everyone in her group&rsquo;s preferences were honored when planning these trips.</p>
<h2 id=wireframing--testing>Wireframing & testing</h2>
<p>I set out to design a basic user flow that captured the core functionality of the app. It would let you create a new trip with a destination city, add sights to see and meals to eat, and then would <strong>automatically suggest an itinerary</strong>, based on your configured preferences. If you didn&rsquo;t like the suggested itinerary, you would &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; it to get a new suggestion.</p>
<p>The first round of designs were simple wireframe sketches. These screens covered all of the steps in that user flow, as well as some onboarding steps.</p>
<p>After doing some usability testing with these, I built a set of low-fidelity digital wireframes in Adobe XD. I made these screens into a clickable prototype and did another round of usability testing.</p>
<h2 id=final-prototype>Final prototype</h2>
<p>In the end, I built my high-fidelity clickable prototype in Figma. I developed a simple style guide using Figma components to keep the design consistent, and I relied heavily on <a href=https://unsplash.com/>Unsplash</a> for free images.</p>

<h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The feedback I received on the final prototype was generally positive, but there are several pieces I&rsquo;d develop further in a future iteration. Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to think harder about the &ldquo;edit trip details&rdquo; workflow (not fully built-out in the prototype), and I&rsquo;d like to do another round of research focused on the itinerary generation feature: Is the &ldquo;Shuffle&rdquo; button clear? Is there a way to make it more useful?</p>
