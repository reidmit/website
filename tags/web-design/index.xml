When I see a website I admire, I often spend time digging to see how it was built. So, I wanted to share the details behind how this site is made.
There are tons of great options out there for this kind of thing, all with different strengths: Wordpress, Jekyll, Hexo, Gatsby, to name just a few.</description></item><item><title>A new website (finally!)</title><link>https://reidmit.com/writing/a-new-website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2017 05:17:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reidmit.com/writing/a-new-website/</guid><description>Welcome to my new website!
After several years of designing and redesigning, building and rebuilding, deleting and recreating my personal website an absurd number of times (30?), all without ever putting any real content on it, I have decided that enough is enough.
