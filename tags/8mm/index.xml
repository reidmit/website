I made them for a class called Handmade Film, in which we were encouraged to experiment with different ways to intervene upon the film before and after developing it.
The process involved shooting some footage, developing it in a darkroom, cutting/rearranging/scratching the film strips, digitizing the footage with a telecine machine, and then doing final editing and sound design with Adobe Premiere.</description></item><item><title>Wounded Sky</title><link>https://reidmit.com/projects/wounded-sky/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reidmit.com/projects/wounded-sky/</guid><description>I made this music video for Ruby Reilly&amp;rsquo;s original song &amp;ldquo;Wounded Sky.&amp;rdquo; Check out more of Ruby&amp;rsquo;s music here.
Ruby is from my hometown. I was home from college for Christmas break, I had recently acquired a Super 8mm film camera from a garage sale, and I loved Ruby&amp;rsquo;s music. I felt this song especially could fit with the analog film aesthetic, so we set out to make this video happen.</description></item></channel></rss>
