The library is open source, written in React and CSS, and can be found on GitHub. The documentation, plus examples of the components in use, can be found in our style guide.
This was such a fun project to work on, and I cannot overstate how much I learned.</description></item><item><title>Redraw</title><link>https://reidmit.com/projects/redraw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reidmit.com/projects/redraw/</guid><description>Redraw is a tool for making pixel art. Try it out!
The code is all on GitHub. It&amp;rsquo;s written in React and uses the HTML5 canvas for drawing.
I started this project during a vacation at home. I was getting nostalgic for all the time I used to spend making drawings in MS Paint. I no longer have a Windows computer, so I went looking for a browser-based replacement. I found JsPaint, which is an amazing recreation of the old version of Paint that I loved.</description></item></channel></rss>
