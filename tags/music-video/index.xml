Ruby is from my hometown. I was home from college for Christmas break, I had recently acquired a Super 8mm film camera from a garage sale, and I loved Ruby&amp;rsquo;s music. I felt this song especially could fit with the analog film aesthetic, so we set out to make this video happen.</description></item></channel></rss>
