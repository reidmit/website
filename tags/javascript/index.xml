You may have heard about callbacks, promises, or async/await. These were things that took me a long time to grasp. Even well into writing JavaScript every day at my job, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully comfortable with my understanding. In this post, I want to share how I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to think about asynchronous programming: what it means, why it&amp;rsquo;s useful, and how it&amp;rsquo;s implemented in JavaScript.</description></item><item><title>Redraw</title><link>https://reidmit.com/projects/redraw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reidmit.com/projects/redraw/</guid><description>Redraw is a tool for making pixel art. Try it out!
The code is all on GitHub. It&amp;rsquo;s written in React and uses the HTML5 canvas for drawing.
I started this project during a vacation at home. I was getting nostalgic for all the time I used to spend making drawings in MS Paint. I no longer have a Windows computer, so I went looking for a browser-based replacement. I found JsPaint, which is an amazing recreation of the old version of Paint that I loved.</description></item><item><title>Pixers</title><link>https://reidmit.com/projects/pixers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reidmit.com/projects/pixers/</guid><description>Pixers is a tool for creating generative art, pixel-by-pixel. You define a few parameters (color palette, number of pixers, etc.) and let the pixers draw you a picture. Even when using the same settings, no two pixer drawings are alike. Try it out!
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I described it when I first made it:
Pixers are tiny (1px by 1px) creatures. They move completely randomly. To start, each pixer is randomly assigned a color from the chosen color palette.</description></item></channel></rss>
