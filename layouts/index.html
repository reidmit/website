<p>Hi, I'm Reid! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
  Iâ€™m a software engineer, writer, and filmmaker based in San Francisco. Iâ€™m passionate about education, accessibility,
  and building experiences that make people's lives a little easier or a little more fun. My pronouns are he/him/his.
</p>

<p>
  These days, Iâ€™m especially interested in front-end web development (JavaScript, React, etc), building accessible user
  interfaces, and programming language design (compiler-writing, type-checking, etc).
</p>
